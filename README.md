# OutdoorSceneSegmentation

Outdoors displacement is among the navigation tasks of mobile autonomous devices.Such displacement may take place in particular environments, like rural roads, characterized by a restricted set of scene elements that surround the displacements. 
Road scene segmentation is important for autonomous driving and pedestrian detection. 
This project proposes to implement a road segmentation algorithm using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). In this project, FCN-VGG16 is implemented and trained with KITTI dataset for road segmentation. Then we compare it to the well known [deeplab](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.00915.pdf) algorithm for segmentation trained on [cityscapes dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01685.pdf).
